There is a unit with an animated border. It merely provides a small background to the situation and has a bit of helpful information for increasing your armies.

## Battle

The player army is always on top and the enemy army at bottom. Turns of both player and enemies are displayed in the board above with a white border. In this case it's a unit called Twisted Jin. Just below the player army are shown the actions that this unit can take. This abilities will change to the ones each unit of the turn has (except enemies).

After selecting an ability by clicking on the button with its respecting name, an extra "Action Icon" will be displayed at the left of the abilities.

With an ability or attack selected you can now choose between the enemy stack, or the player stack if it is a benefical ability, and cast the spell or attack.

The ability "Clear Action" is available to all units. This is to clear the selected action allowing you to preview the cards of the enemy stack which can contain useful information of the stack such as total damage.

Given the size of the stack they both have different damage values. Unit preview by portrait only shows what an individual unit does and not the stack stats combined.

## Endgame

Have victory over the four scenarios to win. If your entire army dies you lose.
