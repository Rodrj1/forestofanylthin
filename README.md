There is a unit with an animated border. It merely provides a small background to the situation and has a bit of helpful information for increasing your armies.

## Battle

The player army is always over the enemy army. Turns of both player and enemies are displayed in the board above with a white border. Just below the player army are shown the actions that this unit can take. This abilities will change to the ones each unit of the turn has (except enemies).

With an ability or attack selected you can now choose between the enemy stack, or the player stack if it is a benefical ability, and launch the action.

The ability "Clear Action" is available to all units. This is to clear the selected action allowing you to preview the cards of the enemy stack which can contain useful information of the stack such as total damage. You CAN'T do this if you have any other action active, you will launch that action instead.

![unselected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97490087/223307119-93c03228-69c0-4f4d-bc63-b04e33fe44c5.png)

Given the size of the stack they both have different damage values. Unit preview by portrait only shows individual unit stats, not the power of the stack.

## Endgame

Have victory over the four scenarios to win. If your entire army dies you lose.
