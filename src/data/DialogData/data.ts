      "You have been summoned to serve the dryexa. In the past we had agreed to leave you, Nicolai of Silorn, alone, in peace, despite your insulting nature. Yet now I call on you to slay one of your own. In the Forest of An-Ilthyn a disgusting being accustomed to your necromantic arts sits now in the ruined city of Sacrelthar diminishing our influence in the forest. She calls herself Velish of House Acarys, apparently an influential family from beyond the seas. I will not tolerate this insult to our land any longer than I must, and sickened as I am of your pest I order you to obey this command: slay Velish Acarys and her minions or I swear that the peace once held shall be broken and the forest will take its due revenge on you and your precious temple in Silorn. Go now and slay your undead familiars for the good of all. All of them.",
    velish:
      "A member of House Acarys. Matters not. Velish, like you, wields necromantic arts. I assume her army comes from the human city nearby, as there isn't any report of our own falling to her. Still, I would not risk much to deal with one such as Velish, not as long as we have you. It seems this Velish holds great spiritual power, but rumor is her lifeforce is somewhat dubious. Scouts that went to the human city say she escaped from beyond the seas where House Acarys resides, that a war is raging on there, and she feared it enough to ran away. But we will not welcome another one of you to this lands.",
    reinforcements:
      "Set your sight north where the human cemetery lies. They let Velish pass unhindered to defile this lands, I will show no compassion towards them. I assume Velish has already some minions there trying to bolster the size of her army. Defeat them, raise the treacherous humans from their graves and your shall have the numbers you need to succeed. There is only one help of mine I'm willing to lend. Go towards the Gloomy Forest. There I set ten rangers to deal with any undead prowling the wilderness. I had already marked you with the crest of the forest, they will not attack you. Once the undead in the Gloomy Forest are dealt with, they will join your ranks.",

      "We ask for your help to contend against a common menace. A foul undead army prowls the area in the forest of An-Ilthyn led by a necromancer called Velish Acarys. We ask this as a favor, we wish not to deal with their like ourselves, we have enough with the wretched Nicolai that is allowed some peace in Silorn. Deal with the dead people Elisith, deal with the one that calls herself Velish, and we shall allow you to keep on with your incursions in our land.",
    velish:
      "There is a war in which the House Acarys fights against House Greythorn and House Bloodrose. These bunch are necromantic heretics that were removed from their lands in Haurbis. Velish fought on the losing side and retreated here with her undead army, past Kimvaema and to the ruined city of Sacrelthar. The land nearby the fort is already getting rotten by this hellish spawn. If you do not help us we will have, to my regret, ask for the help of one of them, Nicolai of Silorn, which I take you already know. One undead lord is enough in this region. As of now we can't but to send some rangers to scout the area until our full force returns from the underground.",
    reinforcements:
      "I sent ten rangers to deal with them, to prevent the undead army from growing. They are in the Gloomy Forest, they will help you if you go there.",
