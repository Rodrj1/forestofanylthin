    'You have been summoned to serve the Dryexa. In the past, we, or rather some, had agreed to leave you, Nicolai of Silorn, alone, in peace, despite your insulting nature. Yet if you may linger in our forests, the due debt must be paid: slay one of your own. In the Forest of An-Ilthyn, a disgusting being accustomed to your necromantic arts sits now in the ruined city of Sacrelthar, diminishing our influence in the forest. Velish of House Acarys, apparently an influential family from beyond the seas. I will not tolerate this insult to our land any longer than I must, and sickened as I am of your pest, I order you to obey this command: kill Velish Acarys and her minions, or the "covenant" once held shall be broken, and the forest will take its due revenge on you, and your precious temple in Silorn, soon after Velish is dealt with. Kill all of them.',
  velish:
    'A member of House Acarys. Her army comes from the human city nearby, as there is not any report of our own falling to her. Still, I would not risk much to deal with one such as Velish, that is your task. It seems this Velish holds great spiritual power, but rumors say her lifeforce is somewhat dubious. Mayhaps that "Grave Magic" of hers is spent. Scouts that went to the human city say she escaped from beyond the seas where House Acarys resides, that a war is raging on there, and she feared it enough to ran away. But she is not welcome in this lands, now or ever. No covenants have been brokered with her. Thus you shall kill her.',
  reinforcements:
    'Set your sight north, where the human cemetery lies. They let Velish pass unhindered to defile this lands, I will show no compassion towards their deceased. Velish has already some minions there trying to bolster the size of her army. Defeat them, raise the treacherous humans from their graves, and your shall have the numbers you need. There is only one help of mine I am willing to lend. Go towards the Gloomy Forest. There, I set ten rangers prevent the pace of her growing army. I had already marked you with the Crest of the Forest. Though you are undead, they will not attack you. Once the undead in the Gloomy Forest are dealt with, they will join your ranks until your task is completed.',

    'We ask for your help to contend against a common menace. A foul undead army prowls the area in the forest of An-Ilthyn led by a necromancer called Velish Acarys. We ask this as a favor, we wish not to deal with their like ourselves. We have enough with the wretched Nicolai that is allowed some peace in Silorn. Deal with them, Elisith, deal with the one that calls herself Velish, and we shall allow you to keep on with your incursions in our land.',
  velish:
    "There is a war in which the House Acarys fights against House Greythorn and House Bloodrose. These bunch are necromantic heretics that were removed from their lands in Haurbis. Velish fought on the losing side, and retreated here with her undead army, past Kimvaema and to the ruined city of Sacrelthar. The land nearby the fort is already getting rotten by this hellish spawn. If you do not help us we will have, to my regret, ask for the help of one of them, Nicolai of Silorn, which I take you already know. One undead lord is enough in this region. As of now, we can't but to send some rangers to scout the area, until our full force returns from the underground. Rumors say her lifeforce is somewhat dubious, she might be spent of necromancy.",
  reinforcements:
    'I sent ten rangers to deal with them, to prevent the undead army from growing at a faster pace. They are in the Gloomy Forest. If you take care of the undead, you may say that Ydris sent you, and they will help you if you in your next battles. Hopefully to victory.',
